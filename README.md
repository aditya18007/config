# Linux how I like

This is a reference guide for me when I setup a workstation in future

## Distros
* Debian : My first linux and always first choice. (Love at first sight)
* Ubuntu : If I want support for NVIDIA graphics card etc.

## Package Manager
* apt: Easy to use and well supported package manager.
* There are large resources for apt on internet.
## Desktop Environment
* GNOME is my favourite.
*  Beautiful and minimalist. 

## Applications
* I use only four applications : Terminal, Web browser, text editor, Typora
* There are other system utilities that I need.

## Terminal 
#### Emulator
* I like the default ZTerminal of Ubuntu
* But, most of the times, I feel the need of multiple terminal windows as available with Terminator

#### Bash Shell
* I haven't used any other shell like zsh or fish.
* I do not feel the need as of now

#### Tmux
* With neovim, Tmux is a really helpful tool
#### Theme
* Even thoug default theme is good, Powerline seems a good addition.
* For adding powerline : https://fedoramagazine.org/add-power-terminal-powerline/
* Powerline for tmux : https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux

#### Fonts
* I love Ubuntu mono.
* After that monospace regular.
* I like big font size : 20

## Text Editor / IDEs
#### Neovim
* If the project is small 
* If the project is written by me from scratch
* Not too many external libraries are involved
* Plugin manager : https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
* Configuration : see `init.vim`

#### VScode
* Large projects with multiple libraries involved.
* Some externnal framework is used
* I like the default Visual studio look and feel. Don't feel any need to change that.

#### IDE
* I do not feel the need for any IDE. I believe Visual Studio can work well.
* Though I haven't worked with a project with more than 100,000 lines.
* I really like JetBrains IDEs and would love them.
* Visual Studio is also good. USed it with OpenGL project. (But I do not use too much windows)

## Browsers
### Firefox
* Robust, private.
* I do not use any plugins. 
* I DO NOT want any new suggestions, articles etc. I want full control over my browsing.

### Edge
* It is fishy. But stable and robust.
* I use it for stuff like email etc.
* Edge has a great interface and a brilliant pdf reader + annotator.
* I do not do everyda browsing and all on it

### Typora
* I love typora
* I do all my assignments in typora
* As long as it is free, i do not see myself going to something else
